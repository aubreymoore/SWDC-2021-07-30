The conference is still on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Adrian Ares, associate director of the Western Pacific Topical Research Center (WPTRC) at UOG, who spearheaded this effort, had this to say about this locally produced effort filmed by Tim Rock and narrated by Bruce Lloyd, “We strongly feel this video is representative of the island’s beauty, immense adversities, and the dedicated individuals working to overcome these difficulties.”  For more information please visit www.uog.edu/wptrc},
